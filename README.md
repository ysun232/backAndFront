# backAndFront


Little project that uses Maven, Spring boot, Thymeleaf and some elements of html. 
The project connects to a MySQL database as the back-end, and produces and html page with thymeleaf elements.
We are able to change elements in the back end with the html page.

I populated the database with some random users obtained from UserInitializer and the RandomUtil
